## Abstract

Microbial bioelectronic devices integrate naturally occurring or synthetically engineered electroactive microbes with microelectronics. These devices have a broad range of potential applications, but engineering the biotic-abiotic interface for biocompatibility, adhesion, electron transfer, and maximum surface area remains a challenge. Prior approaches to interface modification lack simple processability, the ability to pattern the materials, and/or a significant enhancement in currents. Here, a novel conductive polymer coating that significantly enhances current densities relative to unmodified electrodes in microbial bioelectronics is reported. The coating is based on a blend of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) crosslinked with poly(2-hydroxyethylacrylate) (PHEA) along with a thin polydopamine (PDA) layer for adhesion to an underlying indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. When used as an interface layer with the current-producing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, this material produces a 178-fold increase in the current density compared to unmodified electrodes, a current gain that is higher than previously reported thin-film 2D coatings and 3D conductive polymer coatings. The chemistry, morphology, and electronic properties of the coatings are characterized and the implementation of these coated electrodes for use in microbial fuel cells, multiplexed bioelectronic devices, and organic electrochemical transistor based microbial sensors are demonstrated. It is envisioned that this simple coating will advance the development of microbial bioelectronic devices.
