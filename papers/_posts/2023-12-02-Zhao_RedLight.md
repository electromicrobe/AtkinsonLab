## Abstract

Optogenetics is a powerful tool for spatiotemporal control of gene expression. Several light-inducible gene regulators have been developed to function in bacteria, and these regulatory circuits have been ported into new host strains. Here, we developed and adapted a red light-inducible transcription factor for Shewanella oneidensis. This regulatory circuit is based on the iLight optogenetic system, which controls gene expression using red light. Promoter engineering and a thermodynamic model were used to adapt this system to achieve differential gene expression in light and dark conditions within a S. oneidensis host strain. We further improved the iLight optogenetic system by adding a repressor to invert the genetic circuit and activate gene expression under red light illumination. The inverted iLight genetic circuit was used to control extracellular electron transfer (EET) within S. oneidensis. The ability to use both red and blue light-induced optogenetic circuits simultaneously was demonstrated. Our work expands the synthetic biology toolbox of Shewanella, which could facilitate future advances in applications with electrogenic bacteria.
