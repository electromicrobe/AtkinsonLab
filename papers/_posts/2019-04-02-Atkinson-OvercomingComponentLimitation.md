## Abstract

Protein fission and fusion can be used to create biomolecules with new structures and functions, including circularly permuted proteins that require post-translational modifications for activity, split protein AND gates that require multiple inputs for activity, and fused domains that function as chemical-dependent protein switches. Herein we describe how transposon mutagenesis can be used for protein design to create libraries of permuted, split, or domain-inserted proteins. When coupled with a functional screen or selection, these approaches can rapidly diversify the topologies and functions of natural proteins and create useful protein components for synthetic biology.
