## Abstract

Adenylate kinases (AKs) have evolved AMP-binding and lid domains that are encoded as continuous polypeptides embedded at different locations within the discontinuous polypeptide encoding the core domain. A prior study showed that AK homologues of different stabilities consistently retain cellular activity following circular permutation that splits a region with high energetic frustration within the AMP-binding domain into discontinuous fragments. Herein, we show that mesophilic and thermophilic AKs having this topological restructuring retain activity and substrate-binding characteristics of the parental AK. While permutation decreased the activity of both AK homologues at physiological temperatures, the catalytic activity of the thermophilic AK increased upon permutation when assayed >30 Â°C below the melting temperature of the native AK. The thermostabilities of the permuted AKs were uniformly lower than those of native AKs, and they exhibited multiphasic unfolding transitions, unlike the native AKs, which presented cooperative thermal unfolding. In addition, proteolytic digestion revealed that permutation destabilized each AK in differing manners, and mass spectrometry suggested that the new termini within the AMP-binding domain were responsible for the increased proteolysis sensitivity. These findings illustrate how changes in contact order can be used to tune enzyme activity and alter folding dynamics in multidomain enzymes.
