## Abstract

As the impacts of engineering biology grow, it is important to introduce the field early and in an accessible way. However, teaching engineering biology poses challenges, such as limited representation of the field in widely used scientific textbooks or curricula, and the interdisciplinary nature of the subject. We have created an adaptable curriculum module that can be used by anyone to teach the basic principles and applications of engineering biology. The module consists of a versatile, concept-based slide deck designed by experts across engineering biology to cover key topic areas. Starting with the design, build, test, and learn cycle, the slide deck covers the framework, core tools, and applications of the field at an undergraduate level. The module is available for free on a public website and can be used in a stand-alone fashion or incorporated into existing curricular materials. Our aim is that this modular, accessible slide deck will improve the ease of teaching current engineering biology topics and increase public engagement with the field.
