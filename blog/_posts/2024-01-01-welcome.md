Welcome.  I created this site to host my lab's work. This website is a fork of <a class="off" href = "http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> theme from Trevor Bedford at Fred Hutch (<a class="off" href="https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master">GitHub</a>). 

Large projects have a natural home as articles  in scientific journals.  However, I'll often spend an afternoon following up on some small thing that's of passing interest to me.  I would like to keep a journal of these small creations.  Not planning a blog, but something involving a bit more novelty.  We'll see what happens...
