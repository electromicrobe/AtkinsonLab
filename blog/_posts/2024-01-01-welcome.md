Welcome.  This is the first post on the Atkinson Lab website. I created this site to host my lab's work. This website is a heavily modified fork of <a class="off" href = "http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> theme from Trevor Bedford at Fred Hutch (<a class="off" href="https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master">GitHub</a>). 

Here is where we'll post new opportunities in the lab and highlight recent work and progress of the lab members. And who knows this may end up as a space to publically explore research ideas, post about best practices, and general musings.
