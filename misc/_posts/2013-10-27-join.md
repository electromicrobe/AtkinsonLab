**We are recuiting at all levels.**  We place particular emphasis on individuals with a background in synthetic biology, protein engineering, civil & environmental engineering, electrochemistry, and especially their intersection. 

We encourage applications from biologists, physicists, engineers, chemists, women and men, high school students through postdocs. We are committed to improving diversity in engineering biology and fostering peer-mentorship and interdisciplinary science. Applicants of diverse backgrounds are particularly encouraged to apply.

## Undergraduate students
Positions are available for students with interests ranging from environmental biotechnology to synthetic biology. Mechanisms are available to perform research for credit as [Independent Study - CEE 376](https://www.princeton.edu/academics/area-of-study/civil-and-environmental-engineering?page=1) or a [Senior Thesis - CEE 478](https://www.princeton.edu/academics/area-of-study/civil-and-environmental-engineering?page=1). Funded summer research opportunities that can be applied for include the [Bioengineering Summer Undergraduate Research Program](https://bioengineering.princeton.edu/join-us/summer-undergraduate-research-program) and the [High Meadows Environmental Internship Program](https://environment.princeton.edu/education/internships/). Students interested in independent research should contact Josh by <a href="mailto:joshatkinson@princeton.edu">email</a>.

## Graduate students

Positions are available for students interested in synthetic biology, protein engineering, and bioelectrochemistry at the interface of civil & environmental engineering. Students interested in the [CEE graduate program](https://cee.princeton.edu/graduate/how-apply) should directly reach out to Josh by <a href="mailto:joshatkinson@princeton.edu">email</a>. Please send (1) a cover letter that includes a short statement of research interests and (2) a current CV. 

## Postdoctoral fellows

Please send (1) a cover letter that includes the names and contacts for three references, (2) a short statement of research interests, and (3) a current CV to Josh by <a href="mailto:joshatkinson@princeton.edu">email</a>.
