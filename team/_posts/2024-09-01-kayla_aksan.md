I am a Ph.D. student studying Civil and Evironmental Engineering here at Princeton University. I obtained my B.S. in Microbiology at Rutgers University in 2021. Soon after I worked as a Synthetic Biology Research Associate at LanzaTech in Chicago, Illinois. I am interested in genetic engineering methods to use microbes as a tool for PFAS degradation in order to mitigate the effects of pollution on the climate. Tying my passion for molecular and synthetic biology with environmental engineering is something I am excited to explore during my graduate studies. Outside of research, I enjoy playing video games, spending time with my cats, and hiking.
