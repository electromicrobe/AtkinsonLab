I am a senior at Princeton University studying Chemical & Biological Engineering (CBE). I am joining the Atkinson lab to conduct my Senior Thesis research centered around designing and constructing biosensors that enable real-time detection of environmental contaminants. This project aligns with my own passion for finding pragmatic solutions to environmental challenges by merging engineering principles with synthetic biology approaches. Due to my coastal upbringing in Miami, I have also gained a unique perspective on the acute impacts of climate change and cultivated a particular interest in sustainability regarding marine life. Apart from my research on campus, I am the Vice President of Tiger Inn, Social Chair for Princeton Womenâ€™s Club Soccer, and a member of the Society of Women Engineers.
