I am an undergraduate at Princeton University studying Computer Science with an interest in Computational Biology. I'm passionate about how organism decision making is affected and defined by biochemical stochasticity. At the Atkinson Lab, I hope to contribute to research in bioengineering microbes to degrade forever chemicals like PFAS. Outside the lab, I enjoy playing tennis and badminton, writing short stories, and reading a good book.
