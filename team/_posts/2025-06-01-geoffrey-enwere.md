I am a Biological Engineering student from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology working in the lab as part of Princeton’s 2025 [Bioengineering Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (BE-SURE) program](https://bioengineering.princeton.edu/undergraduate). In the lab, my goal is to build a series of biosensing plasmids for responding to metals, PFOA, and electrical signals in *E. coli* and *S. oneidensis* and to perform initial tests on using gas vesicles to control buoyancy in *S. oneidensis*. Outside of research, I enjoy dumpster diving, history, and exploring my school’s campus!
