I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Princeton University. I obtained my Bachelor of Science from Korea University and before joining the Atkinson Lab, I worked in KIST-Europe Germany and finished my internship at Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST). I hope to integrate synthetic biology and electrochemistry at the level of engineering. Outside of the lab, I enjoy volunteering for educational services, traveling, and working out at the gym.
