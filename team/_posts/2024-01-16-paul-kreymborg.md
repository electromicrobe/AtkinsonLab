I am a research assistant in the Atkinson lab at Princeton. Prior to joining the group, I was an undergrad member of the Dogic Lab at UC Santa Barbara, studying active matter physics in purified protein systems. I hope to apply my background in experimental active matter to the study of electrochemically active bacteria like *Shewanella* and *Geobacter*.

My interests include developing tools to cultivate biofilms, and exploring new ways to perform measurements on their properties.
