I am a junior studying Civil & Environmental Engineering at Princeton University. My research interests lie at the intersection of environmental engineering and synthetic biology, and how these findings may be applied to healthcare. With the Atkinson Lab, I hope to combine these fields as we design biosensors using protein switches that recognize contaminants such as progesterone and estrogen as receptors. Outside of research, I am involved in student organizations on campus such as Princeton University Symphony Orchestra (PUO), Asian American Students Association (AASA), and Princeton Premedical Society (PPMS). I participated in the [Bioengineering Summer Undergraduate Research Program (BE-SURE)](https://bioengineering.princeton.edu/join-us/summer-undergraduate-research-program) in Summer 2024.
