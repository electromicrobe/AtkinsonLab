I'm an Assistant Professor at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.princeton.edu/) and the [Princeton Bioengineering Institute](https://bioengineering.princeton.edu/).

My research program focuses on using protein engineering and synthetic biology approaches to study and control bioenergetic processes in bacteria. I am fascinated by bacterial metabolism and the proteins that have evolved to transport electrons and conserve energy and redox meabolism influences the structure of microbial communities and drive Earth's geochemical cycles. 

Prior to joining Princeton, I was an NSF Postodoctoral Fellow jointly in the lab of [Moh El-Naggar](http://www.elnaggarlab.org/) at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, CA, USA and the [Center for Electromicrobiology](https://bio.au.dk/forskning/forskningscentre/center-for-elektromikrobiologi-cem/) at Aarhus University in Aarhus, DK. I obtained my Ph.D. in [Systems, Synthetic, and Physical Biology](https://sspb.rice.edu/) at Rice University in Houston, TX, USA. There I worked in [Jonathan Silberg](https://www.silberglab.org/)'s lab building ligand-gated protein switches to control electron transfer to control sulfur assimilation in _Escherichia coli_. I did part of my Ph.D. at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in Berkeley, CA, USA where I collaborated with [Caroline Ajo-Franklin](http://cafgroup.rice.edu/) at the Molecular Foundry.

More broadly, I've sought to promote eduction in engineering biology and microbial electrochemsistry through hands-on outreach and open access [curricula development](https://ebrc.org/curriculum-module-introduction-to-engineering-biology/).
