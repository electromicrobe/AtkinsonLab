Yuang earned his B.S. in Environmental Science from Liverpool University and Xi’an Jiao Tong Liverpool University, followed by an M.S.E. in Environmental Engineering from the University of Michigan, where he conducted research under the mentorship of Prof. Lutgarde Raskin. His fascination with the natural world drives his belief in applying nature-inspired principles to advance engineering solutions. One of his notable projects involved mimicking the rumen environment in a bioreactor to enhance hydrolysis performance. Currently, Yuang is deeply intrigued by the potential of cable bacteria and is eager to leverage synthetic biology to explore their applications in ecological engineering and other engineering fields. Outside of his research, Yuang enjoys playing and watching tennis and is a Pokémon fan.
