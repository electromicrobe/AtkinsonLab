I am a sophomore in the Chemical and Biological Engineering department and am joining the lab as part of the CBE junior independent work program! I am interested in protein engineering and electrogenetics. Outside of class, I am on women’s club soccer and I’m a tour guide with Orange Key. In my free time, I love to try new restaurants, play Mario Kart with my roommates, and spend time with friends.
