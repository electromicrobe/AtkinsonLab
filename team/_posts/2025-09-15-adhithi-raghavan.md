Adhithi Raghavan is a postdoctoral researcher jointly in the Atkinson Lab and the lab of Jos√© Avalos at Princeton University. She earned her MSc in Chemical and Biological Engineering at the University of British Columbia, where she explored metabolic flux control using optogenetics and protein fusions. She completed her PhD in Biology at New York University, combining synthetic and computational biology to investigate how chromosome ends and centromeres shape genome integrity during meiosis in budding yeast. At Princeton, she is excited to expand her work at the intersection of synthetic biology and genome engineering with applications in biomanufacturing. Outside the lab, Adhithi enjoys cooking (and eating) new recipes, getting hooked on TV shows, and reading.
