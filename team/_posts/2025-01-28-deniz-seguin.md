I am a Junior majoring in Chemistry with minors in Visual Arts and Bioengineering. My research interests revolve around the application of protein engineering in detecting (and finding solutions for) harmful contaminants in our environment. Beyond academics, I am a Programming Chair of Princeton Student Events Committee, a Committee Member for USG's Campus and Community Affairs, and the Events Chair of Towards an Inclusive Community of Undergraduate Physicists.
