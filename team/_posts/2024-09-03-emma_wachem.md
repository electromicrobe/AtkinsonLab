I am a Senior majoring in Civil and Environmental Engineering and am joining the Atkinson lab for my thesis. A lot of my coursework has been around water quality, and I joined the lab as I was interested in researching from a more biological perspective.
Beyond academics, I’m an active member of the Princeton Women’s rowing team. When I’m not in the lab or on the water, I enjoy going to the gym, getting 8 hours of sleep and hanging out with friends.
