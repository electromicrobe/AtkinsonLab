On campus, I am president of Princeton’s chapter of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, a French horn player in the Princeton University Orchestra and Sinfonia, Head editor of the Daily Princetonian’s Humor section, and an RCA in New College West.

Spencer did his CBE senior thesis titled "Synthesis of a cell-embedded conductive polymer hydrogel as a bioelectronic interface" in 2024-25
