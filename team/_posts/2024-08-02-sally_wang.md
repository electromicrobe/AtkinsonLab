Sally is a PBI2 distinguished postdoctoral fellow jointly in the Atkinson Lab and the lab of Jose Avalos at the Princeton University. She obtained her B.S. in Biochemistry at National Taiwan University, and her Ph.D. in Bioengineering at the University of Maryland, College Park under the guidance of Prof. William E. Bentley. During her Ph.D., she studied and engineered native redox stress regulons in E. coli to enable direct electrogenetic interrogation and electronic feedback control of proteins, cells, and cell consortia. She hopes to continue her research of bridging biology and electronics in her postdoctoral training.
Outside of lab, she is a TV addict, pasta/boba connoisseur, and enjoys a good walk.
