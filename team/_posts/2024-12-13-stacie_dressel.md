I am a Ph.D. student in Princeton Universityâ€™s Chemical and Biological Engineering program. Prior to graduate school, I received my B.S. in Biological Engineering at Cornell University. I am incredibly passionate about climate change mitigation and draw inspiration from biological solutions surrounding sustainability and environmental remediation. This will continue to be my broad focus throughout my graduate research in the Atkinson lab. In my free time, I enjoy running, singing, crocheting, and I am a huge ice cream enthusiast!
