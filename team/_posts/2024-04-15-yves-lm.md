I am a French visiting student research collaborator from Université Paris Saclay where I’ve been studying microbiologie and ecology. My previous research project includes iGEM with Paris-Bettencourt team, an international synthetic biology competition, where in 2022 we were trying to create a standardized interface to control gene expression with electrical currents. Before that experience, I’ve been in Vincent Libis's team at the Learning Planet Institute in Paris where I explored the diversity of soil actinomyces secondary metabolites to find new antibiotics.

I am now joining the Atkinson group with the idea of building protein switches for the biosensing of pollutants in water and developing electrogenetic circuits in electroactive bacteria. I am really interested in creating interfaces between electronics and biology, combining the specific advantages of both to form new devices that could serve a sustainable future.
